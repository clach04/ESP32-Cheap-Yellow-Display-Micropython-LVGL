# CYD2-MPY-LVGL
Experimenting with LVGL for Micropython on cheap yellow display.

The Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) is a low-cost device comprised of a ESP32-WROOM with a
ILI9431 2.4' Display and a xpt2046 touch pad.

It can be flashed  with a  custom micropython firmware containing micropython lvgl to create a gui.

Two similar versions of CYD are available. The first version has one USB port (i call this "CYD") and the second version
features two USB ports (i call this "CYD-2"). Although the remaining components are identical, there seems to be a difference in the
display driver.
