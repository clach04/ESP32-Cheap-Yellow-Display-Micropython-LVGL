# CYD2-MPY-LVGL

## Introduction
Experimenting with LVGL for Micropython on cheap yellow display.

The Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) is a low-cost device comprised of a ESP32-WROOM equipped with a
ILI9431 2.4' Display and a xpt2046 touch pad and some more peripherals. I ordered it on AliExpress for 6,19$.

Two similar versions of CYD are available. The first version has one USB port (i call this "CYD") and the second version
features two USB ports (i call this "CYD-2"). Although the remaining components are identical, there seems to be a difference in the
display driver. 

Unfortunately, I ordered the version with two USB ports and the available demo is written for the one-port CYD.
Therefore, spent a lot of time getting it to work with Micropython firmware.
